### christmas carol
* Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas,” taking advantage of the repetition in the song.

### company database
* Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company. For example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.

### days between dates
* Create a function that takes two dates and returns the number of days between the first and second date. - https://edabit.com/challenge/3hdXjfJozQySRC3gE

### fibonacci
* Generate the nth Fibonacci number
* https://github.com/dbuchacher/challenges/blob/main/fibonacci/src/main.rs

### find median and mode
* Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the median (when sorted, the value in the middle position) and mode (the value that occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.

### harvest festival
```
    You have cultivated a plant, and after three long months, the time has come to reap the fruits (or the flowers, in this case) of your hard work. During the growth phase, you added water and fertilizer, and kept a constant temperature. It's time to check how much the plant has grown!
    A plant is represented horizontally, from the base to the left, to the end to the right:
    ---@---@---@
    The stem is made of hyphens, and the flowers are represented by symbols. A plant always starts with the stem, and always ends with flowers.
    The four given parameters are:
        seed (string) determines the type of flowers generated by the plant.
        water (integer) each unit of water extends the portion of stem between the flowers, and gives the total number of segments (stem + flowers) of the plant.
        fert (integer) each unit of fertilizer increases the amount of flowers, grouped in clusters.
        temp (integer) if the temperature recorded is between 20°C and 30°C (bounds included) the plant grows normally, otherwise all the flowers die, except for a single survivor at the end of the stem.
    Given the above parameters, implement a function that returns a string representing the plant (see the examples below for a better visualization).

### how much is true
* Create a function which returns the number of true values there are in an array. - https://edabit.com/challenge/GLbuMfTtDWwDv2F73

### pig latin
* Convert strings to pig latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word and “ay” is added, so “first” becomes “irst-fay.” Words that start with a vowel have “hay” added to the end instead (“apple” becomes “apple-hay”). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!
